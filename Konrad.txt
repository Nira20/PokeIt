I need to write some dialog for a god of greed and war. 


Konrad, God of Greed and War
Domain: Bathypelagic Zone (Midnight Zone).
̷̃̽a̸͆̉t̷̀̓ĥ̶̓e̴͑̄ŕ̷̀  : Abbadon, god of forbidden knowledge, primal hunger, fey-reincarnation cycle. 
Father: Thorn, Cursed Frost Giant, to be killed and reborn when he finds his love Nira. 
Mother: Nira, Goran Princess, cursed to live forever, to find her love and watch him die over and over again.


Born of 3 wishes, a mothers desire to bear and raise a child of her true loves soul. A fathers desire for family of his own blood. A gods desire for an extension of himself to devour his enemies.

Konrad Blackice wants it all. His hunger unrelenting, eternal and picky. 

He cares not for the bloodshed or lives lost. They are unimportant before his own desires. Everything of Value is his.   

 


Backstory is he is the Son of an Eldrich horror born to kill the enemy of his f̷̃̽a̸͆̉t̷̀̓ĥ̶̓e̴͑̄ŕ̷̀ (father).

The god of greed was like "Nah" and decided he wanted it all instead. 
God of Greed and War. His domain is the  Bathypelagic Zone (Midnight Zone). His fathers domain is the Abyssopelagic Zone (The Abyss) (in my Setting its called Abaddon) . No one talks about the Hadal zone.
